Table descriptions and relationships:

user will hold the user's data. Each row will hold their info in a one to one fashion. It will be unique.
    
recipe list will be sharable, but only its recipes that are public. It will have recipe name, instructions, and ingredients.
    a many to many relationship will be between this and user (any user can access any recipe), so another table will be made. 
        
        Table will have recipes_id and user_id

grocery list will hold groceries and the recipes ingredients.
    one to one between this and user, since it's their grocery list. 
    many to one will be between recipes and this, since it can have multiple set of recipes ingredients.

occasions hold the occaion title and what recipes are involved.
    many to one on recipes and occasions (an occaion can have many recipes, but not visa-versa).
    one to many on users and occasions(a user can have many occasions, but not visa-versa).
